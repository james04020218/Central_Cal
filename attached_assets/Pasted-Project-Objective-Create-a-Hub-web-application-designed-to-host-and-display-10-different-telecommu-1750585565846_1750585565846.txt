Project Objective:Create a "Hub" web application designed to host and display 10 different telecommunication plan calculators. This application will serve as a gateway, allowing users to easily select and interact with their desired calculator. Critically, all interfaces must be designed with a "Mobile-First" principle to ensure a premium user experience on mobile devices.Core Requirements:Hub & Spoke Architecture:index.html (The Hub): This is the main screen where users can select one of the 10 calculators.calculators/ (The Spokes): A directory to store the source HTML files for each individual calculator (e.g., kt_calculator.html, skt_calculator.html, etc.).Calculator Selection Interface (Crucial):Implement a card-based UI at the top of the hub page for selecting one of the 10 calculators.Each card must feature the respective company's logo (e.g., KT, SKT, LGU+ logo images), the calculator's name (e.g., "KT Internet Bundle"), and a brief description.When a user taps (or clicks) a card, it must visually enter a 'selected' state (e.g., change border color, apply a subtle shadow) to provide clear feedback.Calculator Embedding via <iframe> (Protect Original Code):Upon selection, the corresponding calculator must be displayed within an <iframe> in a designated content area below the selection cards.Crucially, you must not modify the provided source code of the calculator files (HTML/CSS/JS). You must dynamically change the src attribute of the <iframe> to load the appropriate calculator (e.g., document.getElementById('calculator-frame').src = 'calculators/kt_calculator.html';).The <iframe>'s height must be automatically adjusted using JavaScript to fit its internal content, preventing the appearance of a second, nested scrollbar, which is poor UX.UI/UX Design Guidelines (Mobile-First Focus):Overall Theme: Modern, clean, and professional to build user trust. Utilize ample white space to avoid a cluttered feel.Layout:Mobile: The calculator selection cards should be in a 2-column grid. The selected <iframe> should appear below, taking the full width.Desktop: The selection cards can be in a 4 or 5-column grid for a better overview.Color Palette:Background: A soft gray (e.g., #f8fafc).Accent Color: A trustworthy color, such as the blue from the KT branding.Card-Specific Colors: Use the primary color from each company's logo for the card's border or an icon to aid in visual distinction.Typography: Use the Noto Sans KR font, establishing a clear visual hierarchy with different font weights and sizes for headings and body text.Interactions:Apply smooth transitions for hover and tap states on the cards (e.g., slight scale-up, shadow changes).Add a gentle fade-in effect when a new calculator is loaded into the <iframe> to enhance the user experience.Example File Structure:/ (root)
